# Training-CNN-on-CIFAR10
This notebook is part of a Foundations of Deep Learning course, it is divided into two parts. 
The first part includes handling of CIFAR10 dataset, creation of a CNN and its training scheme, training the model, visualizing layers. 

The second part is discussing pre-processing and optimization of a model on some geometric shapes. 

The aim of this notebook is for students to explore the different steps, parameters of training a CNN and how to optimize for better results.
